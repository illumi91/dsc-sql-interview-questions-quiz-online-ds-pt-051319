    "# SQL Interview Questions  - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll go through a short quiz containing the types of questions about SQL and relational databases that you can expect to see in an interview. \n",

    "## SQL Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "what are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "1. TEXT\n",
    "2. INTEGER\n",
    "3. REAL\n",
    "4. BLOB\n",
    "\n",
    "To increase its compatibility with other database engines (E.G. mySQL or PostgreSQL), SQLite allows the programmer to use other common datatypes outside of the four mentioned above. This is why you are referring to TEXT INTEGER REAL BLOB as datatype \"categories\". \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary keys of a column are those columns that contains unique values for each single row.\n",
    "Foreign keys instead can contain non-unique values.\n",
    "It's important to understand said difference especially when joining tables.\n",
    "If when we're joining a table with Foreign Keys the result obtained could potentially be multiplied by the number of enntities of the rows present in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can distinguish  different types of relationship entities:\n",
    "1. 1 to 1\n",
    "2. 1 to many\n",
    "3. many to many\n",
    "\n",
    "1 to 1 means we're using the primary key for a Join\n",
    "1 to many means the key we're using is a primary key connected with a foreign key(example 1 customer having diferrent orders)\n",
    "\n",
    "many to many means that there are possibly more relationships between the keys.\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can have 7 different Joins:\n",
    "1. Inner -->  Join just elements in common between tables\n",
    "2. Inner Left -->  Join elements in common between tables all all the elements of the initial table\n",
    "3. Inner Right -->  Join elements in common between tables all all the elements of the joining table\n",
    "4. Outer -->  Join all elements not common between tables\n",
    "5. Outer Left -->  Join just elements not in common between from the initial table\n",
    "6. Outer Right -->  Join just elements not in common between from the joining table\n",
    "7. Full Outer -->  Join all elements\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "A very useful manipulation in SQL is aggregate functions. For example, you may wish to find the mean, median, min or max of a column feature.\n",
    "To do so we need to group by the rows containing same entity and apply the aggregate function that we need.\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_________________________________________\n",
    "If we're joining a table with another and the rows are different the result is multiplied by the number of rows that the initial table has.\n",
    "there are multiple entries for the shared field in both tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "______________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
